        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments, ensuring their trustworthiness is essential.
            This short workshop focuses on leveraging formal reasoning techniques to enhance the reliability, safety, and interpretability of
            Reinforcement Learning (RL), Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and probabilistic models. The talks will explore foundational methods
            for verifying system properties, addressing challenges in handling uncertainty, and integrating these approaches into real-world AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop aims to start a conversation between formal methods and AI researchers towards fostering advancements in trustworthy decision-making.

                <b>Abstract:</b> This talk will be an invitation to causal inference with graphical models, and specifically to robustness and stability issues that appear not to have received the attention they deserve.  Most of the talk will be a survey leading to the formulation of these questions. Parts of the talk will be based on work/discussion with Leonard Schulman, Spencer Gordon, Vinayak Kumar, and Vidya Sagar Sharma.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Markov decision processes (MDP) and continuous-time MDP (CTMDP) are the fundamental models for non-deterministic systems with probabilistic uncertainty. Mean payoff (a.k.a. long-run average reward) is one of the most classic objectives considered in their context. We will discuss an algorithm to compute mean payoff probably approximately correctly in unknown MDP; further, we extend it to unknown CTMDP. We do not require any knowledge of the state space, only a lower bound on the minimum transition probability, which has been advocated in literature.

            <p>
                <b>Abstract:</b> Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) are a well-studied abstraction of
                sequential decision making. Policy Iteration (PI) is a classical,
                widely-used family of algorithms to compute an optimal policy for a given
                MDP. PI is extremely efficient on MDPs typically encountered in practice.
                PI is also appealing from a theoretical standpoint, since it naturally
                yields "strong" running time bounds for MDP planning. Strong bounds depend
                only on the number of states and actions in the MDP, and not on additional
                parameters such as the discount factor and the size of the real-valued
                coefficients. </p>
                <p>
                It has proven surprisingly difficult to establish tight theoretical upper
                bounds on the running time of PI. On MDPs with n states and 2 actions per
                state, the trivial upper bound on the number of iterations taken by PI is
                2<sup>n</sup>. It was not until 1999---nearly four decades after the PI algorithm
                was first published---that this trivial bound was improved, and that by a
                mere linear factor (to O(2<sup>n</sup>/n)). In this talk, I will present a
                line of work that has yielded some improvements over existing bounds. I
                will also present some open problems in the area. The talk is expected to
                be widely accessible, since the analysis only uses basic ideas from
                discrete structures and algorithms.

                Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an Associate Professor in the Department of
                Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology
                Bombay. His research interests include artificial intelligence and machine
                learning, spanning topics such as sequential decision making, multi-agent
                learning, multi-armed bandits, and humanoid robotics. Kalyanakrishnan
                received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Texas at
                Austin. Subsequently he was a Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs Bangalore
                and an INSPIRE Faculty Fellow at the Indian Institute of Science,
                Bangalore. His contributions to robot soccer have received two Best
                Student Paper awards at the annual RoboCup competitions. Kalyanakrishnan
                was also a member of the first study panel of the One Hundred Year Study
                on Artificial Intelligence (AI100), which in 2016 released its report
                titled "Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030".
